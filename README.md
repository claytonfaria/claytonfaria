### Hello ğŸ‘‹ I'm Clayton! 

I am a brazilian ğŸ‡§ğŸ‡· web developer ğŸ’» living in awesome Taiwan ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡¼, the Heart of Asia. I have a very diverse technology experience, for years I successfully launched and managed several PC components.

Nowadays, I am focused on developing with JavaScript, mostly React.js / Next.js in the Front End and Node.js, Express for Back End.

I'm interested in working for companies that use modern technologies such as <strong>React, Next.js, Vue.js, Nuxt.js, Node.js</strong>, and etc. I am looking for a role that challenges and gives me opportunities to learn.
